# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/westonhenderson/">Wes Henderson</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and love tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. From vulnerability management to threat detection, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Please feel free to check them out and see the work I’ve put into enhancing security operations and processes! I am also teaching myself how to code some apps and learning to navigate scripts, so if there are any that peek your interest lets collaborate!
